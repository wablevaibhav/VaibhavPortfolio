development. There are four basic components and some additional application components, which we will learn in\u00a0detail.</p>\n<p><strong>The basic components of an Android application are:</strong></p>\n<ol><li>\n<strong>Activities</strong><br>An activity is a class that is considered as an entry point for users that represents a single screen. A messenger application might have an activity that shows a new notification, another activity which reads messages and another which composes a new\u00a0message.</li></ol>\n<p>Each activity is independent of one another. For example \u2013 camera application can be started in an email application to compose an email that shares an image. The picture below depicts how each new activity adds an item to back stack and how the current activity is destroyed and previous activity is resumed. We will study the life cycle of activity in detail in our Android Activity\u00a0article.</p>\n<p>To implement an activity, extend the Activity class in your subclass:</p>\n<pre>public class MainActivity extends Activity { <br>//code <br>}<br></pre>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/617/1*wpynUVnX0Z_O3MTRd1y-mQ.png\"></figure><p><strong>2. Services</strong><br>A service is a component that runs in the background, it acts as an invisible worker of our application. It keeps updating data sources and activities. It also broadcasts intents and performs tasks when applications are not active. An example of service is we can surf the internet or use any other application while listening to\u00a0music.</p>\n<p>To execute services, extend the Services class in your sub-class:</p>\n<pre>public class MyService extends Services { <br>//code <br>}<br><br></pre>\n<p><strong>3. Content Providers</strong><br>Content Provider is a component that allows applications to share data among multiple applications. It hides the details of the database and can be used to read and write private data of the application which is not shared. It would be a mess to access data from other applications without content providers.</p>\n<p>For example \u2013 you can consider looking for contact details in contact list. Or You might want photos from the gallery which are also provided by Content Provider.</p>\n<p>To implement this, extend ContentProvider in your subclass:</p>\n<pre>public class Provider_Name extendsContentProvider {<br>//code<br>}<br><br></pre>\n<p><strong>4. Broadcast Receiver</strong><br>Broadcast Receiver is a component that responds to broadcast messages from another application or the same system. It can also deliver broadcasts to applications that are not running. For example \u2013 notify the user that the battery is low. Android developers can use broadcast messages in the application or outside the normal\u00a0flow.</p>\n<p>To implement this, extend BroadcastReceiver to your receiver:</p>\n<pre>public class Broadcast_Name extendsBroadcastReceiver {<br>//code<br>}<br></pre>\n<p><strong>Some additional components of an android application:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Intents</strong><br>It is an inter-application message passing framework for communication between android components. It is also used for transferring data between different Activities as well as to start a new service and display a list of contacts in ListView. Example \u2013 the camera application sends an intent to the operating system when the user decides to share a\u00a0picture.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Widgets</strong><br>Widgets are variations of Broadcast Receivers and essential aspects of home screen customization. They display data and allow users to perform actions on\u00a0them.</p>\n<p><strong>There are various types of\u00a0widgets:</strong></p>\n<p>Information widget: These widgets display crucial information and track how the information changes over\u00a0time.</p>\n<p>Example \u2013 Clock widgets and widgets that display weather and time information.</p>\n<p>Collection widget: As the name depicts, collection widgets are a collection of information of the same type. Its use is for browsing information and opening any one of the elements to view\u00a0details.</p>\n<p>Example \u2013 music widgets, as we can skip pause and play music outside the music application.</p>\n<p>Control widget: These widgets display functionalities and by using them, the user can trigger from home screen without opening the application.</p>\n<p>Example \u2013 pause and play the video outside the application.</p>\n<p>Hybrid widget: These widgets combine features of all the other three\u00a0widgets.</p>\n<p>Example \u2013 music player widget is a control widget but it also informs the user about which track is playing currently, which means it is a combination of control and information thus it is termed as hybrid\u00a0widget.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Views</strong><br>View is responsible for drawing and event handling. They are rectangular elements on the screen. Some of the views are EditText, ImageView Button, CheckBox and ImageButton.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Notifications</strong><br>It alerts users when the application is not visible or is inactive. This alert flashes on the screen and then disappears. Example \u2013 Notification of the new incoming message popped on the\u00a0screen.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Fragments</strong><br>A fragment is a portion of the total user interface. Users can combine more than one fragment in a single activity and these fragments can be reused in multiple activities. A fragment generally contains Views and ViewGroups inside\u00a0them.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Layout XML Files</strong><br>Layout is the structure for the user interface in the application. XML files provide different types of layouts for the different type of screen, it also specifies which GUI component, an activity or fragment\u00a0holds.</p>\n<p><strong>7. App APK files</strong><br>Apk file is the package file format that contains the program\u2019s code, resources, assets. The Android operating system uses them for installing mobile applications and middleware.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Resources</strong><br>Resources in Android are for defining Images, texts, string values. Everything is defined in the resource file and it can be referenced within the source code. We will learn about Android Resources, in detail in our next upcoming article on Resources.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<strong>Summary</strong><br>In this blog, we studied basic Android\u2019s Application components and some additional components used for android application development.

Resume Format For Freshers:</strong> <strong>Add Contact Information and Personal\u00a0Details:</strong></p>\n<p>Contact and personal details are the most important aspects of the format of the resume. If they might want to contact you, so\u00a0be sure you get the personal details on your resume are\u00a0right.</p>\n<p>a) What Must to Include in the Contact Info\u00a0Section</p>\n<p>Name: First name, last name (middle name optional).</p>\n<p>Phone Number: Personal cell phone preferred over the\u00a0home phone\u00a0number.</p>\n<p>Email Address:\u00a0Today\u2019s preferred means of communication.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://advisor.cybertecz.in/resume-formats-for-freshers-what-must-to-include-in-the-contact-info-section/\">Read more</a>\u00a0What to Add in Contact Information</p>\n<p>3. <strong>Resume Format For Fresher: Start with a Heading Statement (Resume Summary\u00a0or Resume Objective)</strong></p>\n<p>A) Resume\u00a0Summary:</p>\n<p>A resume summary is a 2-3 sentence summary of your career. You should use a resume summary in basically any situation, unless you\u2019re a recent university graduate or switching careers (in that case, you use a resume objective. More on that\u00a0later!).</p>\n<p>In your resume summary, you need to\u00a0mention:</p>\n<p>Your job and years of experience. E.g.: Customer support representative with 5+ years of experience in the IT industry.</p>\n<p>1 or 2 top achievements (or core responsibilities). E.g. Specialized in technical support, customer care, and user retention.</p>\n<p>Desired goal (generally, passion for working at a specific company). E.g.: Looking for new opportunities as a support lead for a SaaS\u00a0company.</p>\n<p>b) Resume Objective:</p>\n<p>A resume objective is, in a nutshell, the goal of your resume. It communicates your motivation for getting into a new field. As with a resume summary, a resume objective should be around 2-3 sentences.</p>\n<p>As we\u2019ve mentioned before, a resume objective is the go-to for anyone that either has no work experience or is going through a career\u00a0change.</p>\n<p>4. <strong>Format of the Resume:- List Your Relevant Work Experience &amp; Key Achievements</strong></p>\n<p>The standard format for your work experience is as\u00a0follows:</p>\n<p>Job Title/Position</p>\n<p>Company Name / Location / Description</p>\n<p>Achievements and Responsibilities:</p>\n<p>Dates Employed</p>\n<p>What and How much work experience to include on a resume?

Let\u2019s start with the basics \u2013 how to format the education section &amp; what to mention there. Then, we\u2019ll move on to tips &amp; tricks that\u2019ll help you stand\u00a0out\u2026</p>\n<p>The right resume education order is to place your highest degree\u00a0first.</p>\n<p>Add any other degrees after in reverse-chronological order.</p>\n<p>If you finished a university degree, don\u2019t add high school\u00a0info.</p>\n<p>Add any relevant coursework, honors, or awards you received.</p>\n<p>6. <strong>Format of the Resume: Put Relevant Skills that Fit the Job\u00a0Ad</strong></p>\n<p>Another must-have section in your resume is the \u201cSkills\u201d section. Here, you want to mention all your know-how that makes you the perfect candidate for the\u00a0job.</p>\n<p>There are 2 types of skills you can include when writing your\u00a0resume:</p>\n<p>Hard Skills\u00a0(Measurable abilities). This can be anything from coding in Python to knowing how to cook Thai\u00a0cuisine.</p>\n<p>Soft Skills\u00a0(Personal skills).
